<h1>Webpad</h1>
Webpad is a notepad replacement with several extra features
<ul>
<li>No 64 Kb Filesize limitation - files can be any size
<li>Always on top option 
<li>Remappable keymaps - assign editing function to your own control-key combinations
<li>Automatically scrolls the screen so that searched string is highlighted in center of the screen
<li>Browser integration - Clicking on a url (any block starting with 'http' or 'www') will open that url in a <b>new</b> 
  browser window (won't reuse another browser window that you want left alone)
<li>Email integration - clicking on an email link (starting with mailto:) opens out your default mail compose window
<li>Enhanced Search Window optimized for repeat searches (click <a href="search.html">here</a> for details)
<li>Keyboard Shortcuts optimized for one handed (left) access (since your right hand may be on the mouse, not the keyboard)
<bl>ok
</ul>
