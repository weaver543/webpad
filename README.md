# Webpad

Webpad is a notepad replacement with several extra features

*   No 64 Kb Filesize limitation - files can be any size
*   Always on top option
*   Remappable keymaps - assign editing function to your own control-key combinations
*   Automatically scrolls the screen so that searched string is highlighted in center of the screen
*   Browser integration - Clicking on a url (any block starting with 'http' or 'www') will open that url in a **new** browser window (won't reuse another browser window that you want left alone)
*   Email integration - clicking on an email link (starting with mailto:) opens out your default mail compose window
*   Enhanced Search Window optimized for repeat searches (click [here](search.html) for details)
*   Keyboard Shortcuts optimized for one handed (left) access (since your right hand may be on the mouse, not the keyboard) <bl>ok</bl>
